The team has successfully migrated a number of functions which were earlier pen-and-paper procedures (including Admissions, Placements and Course Management), as modules in the system with the aim of integrating all such procedures onto this fully functioning unified system. IRIS is compatible across various software platforms and ensures security of data with strong encryption and a data protection policy in place."
